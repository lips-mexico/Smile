/// The first step in creating a Sass unit test for a mixin is to describe the testing scope. This is
/// done by including the mixin describe() from the True library. In case of an important, large or
/// complex mixin, there will only be one describe() function in the file. In other cases, when mixins
/// are simpler, there can be various description in a single file.
/// @group templates
@mixin _mixin-test-description {
  @include describe('mixin-name() - mixin') {
    // @include _test-module-s00;
    // @include _test-module-e00;
  }
}
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
/// Tests are organized by modules with the possibility of various asserts inside each. Complex mixins
/// will usually have more than one successful and exception test modules. This modules are created 
/// using the mixin it() from the true library and must NOT be created inside the describe() mixin.
/// Every test module will be contained inside a private mixin with the following nomenclature: 
/// _mixin-name--sXX if a successful module or ...--eXX if an exception module. Afterwards, these 
/// modules will be included inside the describe() function.
/// @group templates
@mixin _mixin-test-module {
  // Mixin successful test module description
  // * Test cases
  // @name _mixin-name--x00
  // @group testing
  @include it('Does a test module.') {
    @include assert('Given certain parameter') {
      @include output {
        // @include mixin-name(certain parameters);
      }
      @include expect {
        // Expected styles to be generated by mixin.
      }
